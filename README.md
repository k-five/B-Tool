## Beautiful Tools  

These are several console applications that I have created based on several purpose.  
Since I love illustration and coloring things, I like to create tools that colorize  
their output. The languages that have been used are various; like: `C`, `C++`, `D`,  
and so one.  

## C++  
###[renrem](https://github.com/k-five/renrem)  
A rename and remove program utility based on regular expression, that can rename or  
remove files + colorize what you have matched with that input-regex. It does not --  
supports recursive-search, because I wanted it to be all written by `std`  

## D  
### [drr](https://github.com/k-five/drr)  
A rename and remove program utility based on regular expression, just like **renrem**  
but I support recursive-search, because `D Language` standard library supports it.  

## C  
### [cecho](https://github.com/k-five/cecho)  
A very simple `C` code to show the output of ANSI color on command-line
